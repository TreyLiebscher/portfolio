        <h2 class="infoTitle">Elevation Visualizer</h2>
        <h3>The Goal</h3>
        <p>I’ve always had some trouble with visualizing differences in elevation and I was thinking about how cool and
          helpful it would be if there were some type of tool that could take two addresses and display a graph showing
          the difference in elevation in a side-profile type view. I wasn’t sure how that would even look until I
          remembered 1989’s classic NES game, Bandai Golf: Challenge Pebble Beach.</p>

        <div class="infoPicContainer">
          <div class="infoPicHolder">
            <img class="infoPic" src="http://www.retrogameage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Bandai_Golf_Gameplay1-1.jpg" />
          </div>
          <p class="infoPicCaption">Notice the way that the terrain of the course is displayed above the top-down view.
            This was what I wanted.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>API</h3>
        <p>After some research, I discovered that Google’s Elevation API would offer me exactly what I needed. After
          all, here’s an example picture found in the Elevation API documentation:</p>
        <div class="infoPicContainer">
          <div class="infoPicHolder">
            <img class="infoPic" src="https://geochalkboard.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/elevationservice2.jpg" />
          </div>
          <p class="infoPicCaption">Perfect!</p>
        </div>
        <p>But I quickly realized that while this could show me what I wanted (point A elevation vs point B), there was
          a limitation: the elevation API can only draw a straight line directly from point to point. So, while it was
          a good tool for seeing the elevation between two points, it wasn’t all that relevant to anyone who wasn’t a
          bird and could fly over rivers, mountains, etc.

          Knowing that I wanted this app to follow actual roads for its elevation outputs, I decided to take a look at
          the Google Maps API…
        </p>

        <h3>The Polypoints</h3>
        <p>Google Maps uses large (read: gigantic) numbers of encoded polypoints represent the latitude/longitude of
          points along a road, like this:</p>
        <br>
        <div class="infoPicContainer">
          <p>A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H</p>
        </div>
        <p>In reality, those points are actually quite close together, so I figured that if I did an elevation request
          from A to B, B to C, then C to D and so on, I could piece them all together and get an accurate
          representation of the elevation along that road.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This was all fine until I started looking at how many polypoints there can be in a step of a route, such as
          the number of polypoints for a 30-mile leg of a journey that utilized freeways. There could easily be
          thousands, if not tens of thousands, of points in situations like these. And, the elevation API had a limit
          on how many requests could be made at once.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But, knowing that the polypoints were so close together, I figured I could keep some level of accuracy and
          still get the data I needed by condensing the giant arrays of polypoints by ‘leapfrogging’ over values in
          between and scaling the size of the ‘leap’ according to the maximum amount I could request from the API:</p>
        <div class="infoPicContainer">
          <p>Before</p>
          <p>A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H</p>
          <br>
          <p>After</p>
          <p>A -> C -> E -> G</p>
        </div>
        <p>While there is some degree of accuracy lost with this approach, it is hardly noticeable, as it still gives a
          very accurate visual representation of roads, particularly if one is familiar with them and knows what to
          look for.</p>
